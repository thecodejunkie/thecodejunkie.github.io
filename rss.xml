&lt;p&gt;Today I am very proud to share with you that I have been awarded the very first open-source based MVP! I have been awarded an MVP in the ASP.NET category, as it is the most appropriate given most of my open-source work has been in web-related technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear: there is no pure "open-source MVP" category, instead Microsoft will award MVPs in one of the existing categories, but based on different criteria. However, I feel it is only appropriate to include the OSS moniker in my MVP title, hence I will use &lt;em&gt;ASP.NET OSS MVP&lt;/em&gt; to describe my MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the biggest thing here is the recognition from Microsoft that the work that I have been putting into helping out the .NET ecosystem is appreciated. That by far exceeds any other benefits that this might bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of awesome developers that devote so much time and passion in developing amazing frameworks and projects, all for free, which all help make .NET a better place for everyone. Each and everyone of them deserves this as well and I am happy to also be able to share that starting from the next round of MVP announcements (1st July), Microsoft will start awarding more people an MVP based solely based on open source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can &lt;a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/nominate-an-mvp.aspx"&gt;Nominate an MVP&lt;/a&gt; and if you know someone that you think should get the same kind of recognition, then head over to the nomination form and fill in their details. I know there are a bunch of people that will be getting my nomination!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hanselman"&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt; and everyone else at Microsoft, that have made this change possible and for their hard work to make open-source a first class citizen in their strategy moving forward&lt;/p&gt;

The concept of the day was to give people the opportunity to pitch something they would like to spend the day learning more about and have others form up behind their topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules were simple, you get a couple of minutes to pitch your idea and in order for it to move beyond a pitch, at least one other person had to be willing to spend their day learning with you. If your pitch did not generate any interest you had to join one of the other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were all given the opportunity to post our pitches up front. A lot of interesting topics were brought up such as learning Clojure, using the Web Speech API, Web Components, exploring Roslyn and many many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the moment I saw it, I knew I wanted to form up behind a pitch that suggested we spend the day with &lt;a href="http://www.unity3d.com"&gt;Unity3D&lt;/a&gt; and build games! Turns out, so did others and we found ourselves in a group of 8 developers, all eager to get started hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.knowabunga.unity3d.01.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above screenshot is from the game that I managed to write, from scratch in less than 6 hours without any real prior experience with Unity3D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let us rewind the tape and see what we did during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first order of the day for the group was to set a curriculum. We quickly came to the conclusion that the group were too big for us too all cooperate on a single project and decided that we would split into smaller teams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end we broke up into 5 smaller groups, with me in a group of my own because I had my sights set on creating a side scrolling shoot 'em up game. I seemed like a daunting challenge to complete in less than a full work day, without having any prior experience, but I need a good challenge every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get us started, the ones that had read up a bit started of by sharing what they knew about using from having done a bit of homework up front. Me and a co-worker had spent some time reading up on the basics and watching some of the learning material, so we shared our take on it with the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priority one was to find some decent pre-made art assets that I could use. I could have opened an image editor and drawn something myself, but I figured that somewhere on the internet existed free art that would make my game look much cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching for a while, I found a blog post on MSDN called &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cdnstudents/archive/2013/09/12/free-space-art-assets-to-help-you-build-your-game.aspx"&gt;"Free Space Art Assets to help you build your game"&lt;/a&gt;. The graphics looked nice and the post said two magical things: &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;no strings attached&lt;/em&gt;. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Entering the zone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the rest is a bit of a blur to be honest. I more or less went into a  hour coding frenzy - I got into the zone. I had a small mental check-list of things that I wanted the game to have by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list was really modest and (more or less) looked like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A ship that can move across the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A scrolling background (parallax if time permits)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enemies that fly across the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of weapon that would let me blow the enemy scum to pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics of Unity3D are pretty straight forward. You add &lt;em&gt;Game Objects&lt;/em&gt; to your scene. These game objects can have various &lt;em&gt;Components&lt;/em&gt; added to them. Components are things like audio sources, sprite renderers, animators, colliders, rigidbody (makes your game object be affected by physics) and scripts (to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scripts is what gives your game objects (and world) its behaviors and it is also the thing that made Unity3D so easy for me (and the other people in our group) to get up and running. The reason is that Unity3D built on top of Mono which enables you to write your game code using C# (or JavaScript or Boo). This meant that we did not have to learn a new language, while at the same time learn the concepts of Unity3D and game making in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you attach a script to a game object, then the &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; reference in your script will refer to the game object that it is attached to. This means that you can create a general purpose script and reuse it across different game objects. You can attach multiple scripts to a game object, which makes them extremely powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps if you think about the scripts as &lt;em&gt;Behaviors&lt;/em&gt; (you actually inherit your code from a class called &lt;em&gt;MonoBehavior&lt;/em&gt;) that you attach to your game objects. I can see myself build up a library of scripts that can be reused across multiple projects. Even the camera can have scripts attached to it, so you could create different kind of tracking behaviors (follow player, zoom out when you travel fast etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping it up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I knew it, it was time to wrap up and meet up with the other groups and demo what we had accomplished during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day my game contained&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An infinite scrolling background using a second camera, a quad and texture wrapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three types of enemies, all flying across the screen in various sine curves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A ship that could fire missiles, complete with a pew-pew sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missile explosion sound effect on enemy impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enemy spawners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scripts that de-spawned missiles/enemies that fly of screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The start of a scoring system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some screenshots of other games that were created (can you tell that many of them used the same art asset pack? Free stuff is awesome, he-he) during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.knowabunga.unity3d.02.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.knowabunga.unity3d.03.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.knowabunga.unity3d.04.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.knowabunga.unity3d.05.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not have all the details on all these games, but I can tell you that the last one is a 2-4 player game that uses wireless Xbox 360 controllers to steer your skateboarder. The objective is to try and knock everyone else of the platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I did not have enough time to add the scoring, but I revisited the code over the weekend and added it in, along with particle system based explosions when an enemy was hit. I also added a pause option with a single line of code (again, wrapped it up in a Pause-script that can be re-used).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still undecided if I am going to publish the project on GitHub or not. I am all for open-source, but I need to make sure that the audio assets, that I grabbed of random sites on the internet, does not violate any licenses. The biggest challenge would be to find the sites where I found them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I will most definitely keep evolving my knowledge with Unity3D, because game development is something I have always (and periodically have done using other platforms and tools) wanted to pick up and be more active with. It is a very rewarding and creative process that goes hand in hand with my passion for programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free version of &lt;a href="http://www.unity3d.com"&gt;Unity3D&lt;/a&gt; is great and it works both on Windows and OSX. Unity3D also lets you target a wide range of platforms such as Windows, OSX, Linux, PS3 (PS4 on the way), XBox, Wii-U, Windows Phone, Windows Store Apps, Blackberry 10, iOS, Android and the web with the help of WebGL.&lt;/p&gt;

Last time we devoted all of our time to contribute to a bunch of awesome open-source projects and it was a great success for everybody that participated. Tomorrow we're meeting up again, but this time we will use a different format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge we face is; How do you create a learning oppertunity for nearly 80 people, that all have different passions and paths they would like to explore? The concept we came up with this time was to allow everyone pitch an idea for something they would like to spend the day learning. You then join on of the idea that was pitched and go on a learning frenzy throughout the day!&lt;/p&gt;

You then join on of the idea that was pitched and go on a learning frenzy throughout the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is as simple as it is effecient. Everybody has been given the opportunity to think about things they would like to explore more, and then write up a basic, but to the point, pitch that they post on our internal website. People can read the proposals up front, but each pitch will also be given a couple of minutes to state their case at the start of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One once all the picthes have been made, people form up behind the one they like the most and then we follow a simple agenda throughout the day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pitch (described above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The curriculum (we decide on a curriculum for the day in the group you joined)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hack (codez!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunch (nom-nom!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talks (time to meet up and share what we've been doing and what we've learned)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After work (can't have all work, there need to be some play as well!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be writing a follow up post and let you know how it worked out for us and what kind of pitches that was made. I know I have already made up my mind though! I will be joining a group of people that will be exploring game making using &lt;a href="http://www.unity3d.com"&gt;Unity3D&lt;/a&gt;, which is something I have been playing around with myself the last couple of weeks. Can't wait!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanna follow the event on twitter, you can follow the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23knowabunga&amp;amp;src=typd&amp;amp;f=realtime"&gt;#knowabunga&lt;/a&gt; Twitter hashtag!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that was new to me was the &lt;strong&gt;Behavior&lt;/strong&gt; section at the bottom. More specifically what Microsoft calls &lt;strong&gt;map mode&lt;/strong&gt;. Enabling map mode will turn the vertical scrollbar into a source map, i.e. it will give you an overview of your code, to help you navigate it. This is kind of like the minimap option you find in Sublime Text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/vs2013.scollbars.sourcemap.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable this, you right-click the vertical scroll bar, then you can choose "Scroll Bar Options..." at the bottom of the context menu, or you can select &lt;strong&gt;Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Text Editor -&gt; All Languages -&gt; Scroll Bars&lt;/strong&gt; from the menu. This will bring up a bunch of customizations you can apply to the scrollbars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/vs2013.scollbars.settings.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you see the full content of the file, with the code that is currently in view inside the black area. The white line represents the current line of the cursor. By chaning the value of the &lt;strong&gt;source overview&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown, you can change how wide the source map will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you also enable the &lt;strong&gt;Show Preview Tooltip&lt;/strong&gt; option, you will get a small preview window when you hover the mouse for a bit over the same location in the source map. The preview will show the code at the current mouse cursor position, helping you make sure you are at the right place in your code, before navigating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/vs2013.scrollbars.preview.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not sure if I like it or not, but I am going to leave it on for a while and see if I grow to like or hate it. &lt;/p&gt;

A lot of the questions were about what projects we would be working on and how many people would be involved. However, even more questions were related to how we convinced the company to let us spend a full day doing free work, instead of billing clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version is that we did not have to convince the company at all. We already had the corporate structure in place to enable us to do something like this. The more interesting question really is; why are we able do things like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version is that we did not have to convince the company at all. We already had the corporate structure in place to enable us to do something like this. The more interesting question really is; why are we able do things like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tretton37.com"&gt;tretton37&lt;/a&gt; was founded on the ethos of &lt;strong&gt;"Creating value by sharing knowledge"&lt;/strong&gt;. An important thing to understand is that for us this is just not a marketing strap-line. This is the ethos that defines who we are and it is what attracts people to join our family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have defined five core values that are important to us, as a company, to help us embrace that ethos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craftsmanship as a lifestyle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace the family spirit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you see is what you get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't go into detail about each of the values, but if you are interested to learning more about them, you can find the information at &lt;a href="http://tretton37.com/about-us"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who exactly do we share knowledge with? The answer is &lt;strong&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/strong&gt;. We share knowledge inside the company by organizing weekly code nights, we share knowledge with the community by speaking at conferences, sponsoring user groups and other meetups, being crazy enough to &lt;a href="http://leetspeak.com"&gt;create our own, nearly free, conference Leetspeak&lt;/a&gt; and we share knowledge with our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last year we sponsored 16 user group meetups, spoke at 10 conferences, organized 50 (!) code nights, wrote 82 blog posts and organized the second incarnation of the Leetspeak conference. It just so happens that we created a nice little &lt;a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BfSzq6TCMAAKr46.png:large"&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt; about our past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So sharing knowledge is not something we do, but it's also who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Knowabunga Days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that we love doing is getting the opportunity to all meetup and embrace our ethos and core values. There is not a single ninja at our company that wouldn't tell you this if you asked them. Because of this and because we are consultancy company, which means we spend a lot of our time spread out between our various clients, we needed to create a platform where we could quench the thirst of having everyone meetup and do cool things. That's where the Knowabunga Days came to see the day of lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a Knowabunga Day then? We define them in the following way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So what is a Knowabunga Day? It's the name of the days where we gets the opportunity to gather at our headquarters and further sharpen our swords, learning interesting things by experts and each other. The content and format of the days is created by the ninjas in the Knowledge Committee. The content could be just anything related to our community or our field of knowledge, but the day should be delivered with quality and not just be a day where we hang around at the office.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The thought behind these days goes back to our five core values; maybe most "Craftsmanship as a Lifestyle", "Embrace the Family Spirit" and "Have fun". We state that we focus intently on creating a great environment for gaining knowledge and building a company where we have fun. By doing the Knowabunga Days we try to further develop our own identity and culture as well as maintaining and develop our reputation at existing clients and new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're nothing more than allocated days where we meetup and try and do awesome things while staying true to our core values and our ethos of creating value by sharing knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why an open-source Knowabunga Day?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also asked how and why we decide to spend the day working on open-source. The simple answer is that we all love open-source and many of us regularly contribute to projects and/or maintain them ourselves. The slightly longer answer is that back in November we had a company strategy day, where we all (once again) met up at our offices but this time to talk and plan about our strategy for the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a very flat corporate structure and we also embrace transparency. Truth be told, the company is (not is made up of - pay attention to the distinction) the people that work there. We are all a bunch of geeks with a huge passion for our profession and the software community. Everything around those individuals is there to help facilitate those individuals to get to work with the things that they are passionate about. We work hard, play hard and know when we should be on either side of the line that divides the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So because of this is very important that everybody helps define our strategy for the next couple of year, what we should focus on and what we would love to work more with. During the day, open-source emerged in all sorts of discussions and it became clear that everybody wanted us to actively participate in the open-source community. So that's one of the things we'll be doing, in various formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time for our knowledge committee to plan for our next Knowabunga Day, choosing an open-source theme was the obvious things to do and there were cheers all around when the theme was announced!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Planning the day itself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning the day was, relatively speaking, pretty straight forward and can be summarized with the following check-list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the purpose and goals of the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have everyone sign-up, or decline, to participate during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we know how many that is able to attend we can start planning how to divide people up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask everyone that will be attending what they'd like to work on (front-end, back-end etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask everyone that will attend if they have any projects they would like to recommend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add additional interesting projects to the list of suggested projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select projects that suite the interests of the attending people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide attendees into teams and assign them a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage attendees to read up and explore the project a bit ahead of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell people to prepare their laptops for the environments they will be needing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an awesome day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing to take away from this is that &lt;strong&gt;planning is key&lt;/strong&gt;. We would never have succeeded in producing 23 total (I've previously mentioned 16 but we had not counted both offices at that time) in a single day unless we had made preparations up front - we would have wasted too much time trying to decide what to do and with whom we'd like to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this particular Knowabunga Day we followed a simple agenda when it came to the projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take it for a spin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take it apart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had allocated time for each of these activities to help people familiarize themselves with the project and become confident enough with them to start contributing back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is history...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission for the day was simple; create value for both the team and the open-source community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the day was spent getting to know the project your teams would be working with. The had set time aside to "Take it for a spin", where we grabbed the project and played around with the code and got a basic sample working on our local machines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was "Take it apart" and this is where the real fun started taking place. We dove into the code and tried to figure out how the code was glued together and what made it tick. We had allocated two hours for this, but most teams got excited and started working on pull-requests as soon as they had figured out the mechanics of their projects :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.open.source.day.contributing.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we had two short presentations. I held one on the subject of "The 1-2-3 of Open-Source Contributing", which was a short introduction on a couple of things that it worth knowing up-front before sending any project code. Things like the project licence, contributor licence agreements, copyrights and general DO's and DON'Ts where brought up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.open.source.day.hacking.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The the real hacking started! Everybody was in such an awesome mood and the atmosphere was really great. People where breaking out of their teams to offer help where they could, all for the purpose of making sure that we delivered as much value to the projects as we possibly could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's always fun when we all get to meet up and code together, something we unfortunately don't get to do as much as we want because we're a consultant company and spend a lot of time at clients, but it was especially fun this time because we got to work on some really cool projects and contribute back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.open.source.day.results.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day we took toll and it turned out that we had managed to send in a total of &lt;strong&gt;23 pull-requests&lt;/strong&gt;, which is quite an achievement! I feel to proud of our entire company. Not only for taking the initiative of the day itself, but also for being able to create some tangible value to the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, one of the reoccurring discussions were; "Is the cake a lie?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.open.source.day.cake.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it wasn't! We finished the day by celebrating out awesome day and also the fact that &lt;a href="http://tretton37.com"&gt;tretton37&lt;/a&gt; turned 4 years old! What a day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time (the event will take place 4 days after I've posted this) we decided that we should spend the day working on various open-source projects, by sending them some pull-requests!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;i class="icon-heart"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; open-source and it felt like the right thing for us to do. All of us use various open-source projects in our daily work so it is nice that we, as a company, get to contribute something back (of course many of us send our pull-request otherwise as well!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we want to maximize the amount of time we can spent coding, we have chosen all the project up-front and divided us into teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects that was suggested, and ultimately picked, where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy"&gt;NancyFx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR"&gt;SignalR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs"&gt;ScriptCS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Glimpse/Glimpse"&gt;Glimpse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ninject/ninject"&gt;Ninject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js"&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js"&gt;Handlebars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/knockout/knockout"&gt;KnockoutJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/MiniProfiler/dotnet"&gt;MiniProfiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/elmah"&gt;Elmah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://templatehub.codeplex.com"&gt;Template Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com"&gt;Caliburn.Micro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Nope, I won't be on Team Nancy!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope that all teams get the opportunity to send in at least one pull-request each. Of course, what would be really awesome is if we managed to fire of a couple of them for each project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't wait to get started! Wouldn't it be awesome if you could organize something similar where you work? C'mon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on our Twitter stream &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tretton37"&gt;@tretton37&lt;/a&gt; for updates during our knowledge day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there isn't, but that does not mean it is impossible, or even hard for that matter. Once you figure it out, it is actually quite frictionless and smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easy and, as it turns out, slow way it to go to the Azure Portal, click &lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;, then the name of your storage, followed by &lt;strong&gt;Containers&lt;/strong&gt; at the top. You should now see a container called &lt;strong&gt;Vhds&lt;/strong&gt;. Clicking that will list all of the VHD file you have on your subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By selecting one of the files the then clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt; button, at the bottom of the page, Azure will start a file download straight in the browser. I am on a 100 mbit connection and I was only getting around 4MB/s on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally that is a pretty OK download speed, but I was looking to transfer two VHD files that totalled at 150GB of data. Needless to say it would take quite a while to complete so I needed another solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blob Service REST API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was nice enough to create a nice &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd135733.aspx"&gt;Blob Service REST API&lt;/a&gt; that you can use to programatically access the content of your containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, the API uses the concept of access keys. If you have the name and access key to a storage, then you can use that to access the files that are stored in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You find your keys by going to the Azure Portal, click on &lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt; then &lt;strong&gt;Manage Access Keys&lt;/strong&gt; at the bottom of the page. There are two keys, the primary and the secondary. Both do the same thing, but Azure gives you a convinent way to have a personal key and a key you give to services etc. that you wish to gain access to your storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At anytime you can regenerate theys keys if you feel they've been compromised or if you have given them to some service and you no longer wish them to be valid. Just click the &lt;strong&gt;Regenerate&lt;/strong&gt; button next to the key you wish to create a new one for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AzCopy to the rescue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a couple of different tools, that uses the Blob Service REST API, but they all suffered from the same problem as the browser download option - speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/avidebbo"&gt;David Ebbo&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/04/01/azcopy-using-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx"&gt;AzCopy&lt;/a&gt;. David works on Windows Azure Web Sites and he told me they uses that tool to copy things across blob stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just so happened that as of CTP2, AzCopy supports the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/04/01/azcopy-using-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx"&gt;Asynchronous Cross-Account Copy Blob&lt;/a&gt; feature of the Blob Service REST API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: To use this feature, your storage account must have been created after June 7th 2012. Read more about this limitaion on the previous link&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this enables you to do is to copy from one store to another, without the need to first copying the data locally. This drastically improved the transfer speed. Using AzCopy I was getting speeds at around 45MB/s instead of 4MB/s!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up using the following command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AzCopy
https://&amp;lt;sourceaccount&amp;gt;.blob.core.windows.net/&amp;lt;sourcecontainer&amp;gt;/ 
https://&amp;lt;destaccount&amp;gt;.blob.core.windows.net/&amp;lt;destcontainer&amp;gt;/
/sourcekey:&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;
/destkey:&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;
/S
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it worked great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A word of caution on Azure Disks vs Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had copied the VHD files to my second subscription, I set out to re-create my virtual machines. This is where I messed up a bit. I went into &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Machines&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;Images&lt;/strong&gt; where I created images of the VHD files. What I should have done is gone into &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Machines&lt;/strong&gt; followed by &lt;strong&gt;Disks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two is that images are like templates. You use them to create a completley new VHD file, based on the image, that you then use as a disk for your virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was copying existing machines across, I just needed to create disks directly, that I then used to create my virtual machines from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I created a virtual machine from one of the images, it worked fine (I could login to the machine), except for Azure getting stuck while provisioning my machine. So even though the machine was functional, it was not sitting quite right with Azure. Once I changed to use a disk, it immediatly behaved as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
