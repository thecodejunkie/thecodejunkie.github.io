A lot of the questions were about what projects we would be working on and how many people would be involved. However, even more questions were related to how we convinced the company to let us spend a full day doing free work, instead of billing clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version is that we did not have to convince the company at all. We already had the corporate structure in place to enable us to do something like this. The more interesting question really is; why are we able do things like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version is that we did not have to convince the company at all. We already had the corporate structure in place to enable us to do something like this. The more interesting question really is; why are we able do things like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tretton37.com"&gt;tretton37&lt;/a&gt; was founded on the ethos of &lt;strong&gt;"Creating value by sharing knowledge"&lt;/strong&gt;. An important thing to understand is that for us this is just not a marketing strap-line. This is the ethos that defines who we are and it is what attracts people to join our family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have defined five core values that are important to us, as a company, to help us embrace that ethos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craftsmanship as a lifestyle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace the family spirit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you see if what you get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't go into detail about each of the values, but if you are interested to learning more about them, you can find the information at &lt;a href="http://tretton37.com/about-us"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who exactly do we share knowledge with? The answer is &lt;strong&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/strong&gt;. We share knowledge inside the company by organizing weekly code nights, we share knowledge with the community by speaking at conferences, sponsoring user groups and other meetups, being crazy enough to &lt;a href="http://leetspeak.com"&gt;create our own, nearly free, conference Leetspeak&lt;/a&gt; and we share knowledge with our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last year we sponsored 16 user group meetups, spoke at 10 conferences, organized 50 (!) code nights, wrote 82 blog posts and organized the second incarnation of the Leetspeak conference. It just so happens that we created a nice little &lt;a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BfSzq6TCMAAKr46.png:large"&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt; about our past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So sharing knowledge is not something we do, but it's also who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Knowabunga Days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that we love doing is getting the opportunity to all meetup and embrace our ethos and core values. There is not a single ninja at our company that wouldn't tell you this is you asked them. Because of this and because we are consultancy company, which means we spend a lot of our time spread out between our various clients, we needed to create a platform where we could quench the thirst of having everyone meetup and do cool things. That's where the Knowabunga Days came to see the day of lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a Knowabunga Day then? We define them in the following way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So what is a Knowabunga Day? It's the name of the days where we gets the opportunity to gather at our headquarters and further sharpen our swords, learning interesting things by experts and each other. The content and format of the days is created by the ninjas in the Knowledge Committee. The content could be just anything related to our community or our field of knowledge, but the day should be delivered with quality and not just be a day where we hang around at the office.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The thought behind these days goes back to our five core values; maybe most "Craftsmanship as a Lifestyle", "Embrace the Family Spirit" and "Have fun". We state that we focus intently on creating a great environment for gaining knowledge and building a company where we have fun. By doing the Knowabunga Days we try to further develop our own identity and culture as well as maintaining and develop our reputation at existing clients and new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're nothing more than allocated days where we meetup and try and do awesome things while staying true to our core values and our ethos of creating value by sharing knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why an open-source Knowabunga Day?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also asked how and why we decide to spend the day working on open-source. The simple answer is that we all love open-source and many of us regularly contribute to projects and/or maintain them ourselves. The slightly longer answer is that back in November we had a company strategy day, where we all (once again) met up at our offices but this time to talk and plan about our strategy for the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a very flat corporate structure and we also embrace transparency. Truth be told, the company is (not is made up of - pay attention to the distinction) the people that work there. We are all a bunch of geeks with a huge passion for our profession and the software community. Everything around those individuals is there to help facilitate those individuals to get to work with the things that they are passionate about. We work hard, play hard and know when we should be on either side of the line that divides the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So because of this is very important that everybody helps define our strategy for the next couple of year, what we should focus on and what we would love to work more with. During the day, open-source emerged in all sorts of discussions and it became clear that everybody wanted us to actively participate in the open-source community. So that's one of the things we'll be doing, in various formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time for our knowledge committee to plan for our next Knowabunga Day, choosing an open-source theme was the obvious things to do and there were cheers all around when the theme was announced!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Planning the day itself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning the day was, relatively speaking, pretty straight forward and can be summarized with the following check-list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the purpose and goals of the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have everyone sign-up, or decline, to participate during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we know how many that is able to attend we can start planning how to divide people up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask everyone that will be attending what they'd like to work on (front-end, back-end etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask everyone that will attend if they have any projects they would like to recommend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add additional interesting projects to the list of suggested projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select projects that suite the interests of the attending people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide attendees into teams and assign them a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage attendees to read up and explore the project a bit ahead of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell people to prepare their laptops for the environments they will be needing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an awesome day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing to take away from this is that &lt;strong&gt;planning is key&lt;/strong&gt;. We would never have succeeded in producing 23 total (I've previously mentioned 16 but we had not counted both offices at that time) in a single day unless we had made preparations up front - we would have wasted too much time trying to decide what to do and with whom we'd like to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this particular Knowabunga Day we followed a simple agenda when it came to the projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take it for a spin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take it apart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had allocated time for each of these activities to help people familiarize themselves with the project and become confident enough with them to start contributing back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is history...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission for the day was simple; create value for both the team and the open-source community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the day was spent getting to know the project your teams would be working with. The had set time aside to "Take it for a spin", where we grabbed the project and played around with the code and got a basic sample working on our local machines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was "Take it apart" and this is where the real fun started taking place. We dove into the code and tried to figure out how the code was glued together and what made it tick. We had allocated two hours for this, but most teams got excited and started working on pull-requests as soon as they had figured out the mechanics of their projects :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.open.source.day.contributing.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we had two short presentations. I held one on the subject of "The 1-2-3 of Open-Source Contributing", which was a short introduction on a couple of things that it worth knowing up-front before sending any project code. Things like the project licence, contributor licence agreements, copyrights and general DO's and DON'Ts where brought up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.open.source.day.hacking.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The the real hacking started! Everybody was in such an awesome mood and the atmosphere was really great. People where breaking out of their teams to offer help where they could, all for the purpose of making sure that we delivered as much value to the projects as we possibly could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's always fun when we all get to meet up and code together, something we unfortunately don't get to do as much as we want because we're a consultant company and spend a lot of time at clients, but it was especially fun this time because we got to work on some really cool projects and contribute back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.open.source.day.results.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day we took toll and it turned out that we had managed to send in a total of &lt;strong&gt;23 pull-requests&lt;/strong&gt;, which is quite an achievement! I feel to proud of our entire company. Not only for taking the initiative of the day itself, but also for being able to create some tangible value to the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, one of the reoccurring discussions were; "Is the cake a lie?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/img/tretton37.open.source.day.cake.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it wasn't! We finished the day by celebrating out awesome day and also the fact that &lt;a href="http://tretton37.com"&gt;tretton37&lt;/a&gt; turned 4 years old! What a day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time (the event will take place 4 days after I've posted this) we decided that we should spend the day working on various open-source projects, by sending them some pull-requests!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;i class="icon-heart"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; open-source and it felt like the right thing for us to do. All of us use various open-source projects in our daily work so it is nice that we, as a company, get to contribute something back (of course many of us send our pull-request otherwise as well!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we want to maximize the amount of time we can spent coding, we have chosen all the project up-front and divided us into teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects that was suggested, and ultimately picked, where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Nope, I won't be on Team Nancy!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope that all teams get the opportunity to send in at least one pull-request each. Of course, what would be really awesome is if we managed to fire of a couple of them for each project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't wait to get started! Wouldn't it be awesome if you could organize something similar where you work? C'mon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on our Twitter stream &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tretton37"&gt;@tretton37&lt;/a&gt; for updates during our knowledge day.&lt;/p&gt;

Not having used Azure that much before, I figured there must be support to perform this kind of migration from inside the Azure portal itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there isn't, but that does not mean it is impossible, or even hard for that matter. Once you figure it out, it is actually quite frictionless and smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easy and, as it turns out, slow way it to go to the Azure Portal, click &lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;, then the name of your storage, followed by &lt;strong&gt;Containers&lt;/strong&gt; at the top. You should now see a container called &lt;strong&gt;Vhds&lt;/strong&gt;. Clicking that will list all of the VHD file you have on your subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By selecting one of the files the then clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt; button, at the bottom of the page, Azure will start a file download straight in the browser. I am on a 100 mbit connection and I was only getting around 4MB/s on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally that is a pretty OK download speed, but I was looking to transfer two VHD files that totalled at 150GB of data. Needless to say it would take quite a while to complete so I needed another solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blob Service REST API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was nice enough to create a nice &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd135733.aspx"&gt;Blob Service REST API&lt;/a&gt; that you can use to programatically access the content of your containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, the API uses the concept of access keys. If you have the name and access key to a storage, then you can use that to access the files that are stored in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You find your keys by going to the Azure Portal, click on &lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt; then &lt;strong&gt;Manage Access Keys&lt;/strong&gt; at the bottom of the page. There are two keys, the primary and the secondary. Both do the same thing, but Azure gives you a convinent way to have a personal key and a key you give to services etc. that you wish to gain access to your storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At anytime you can regenerate theys keys if you feel they've been compromised or if you have given them to some service and you no longer wish them to be valid. Just click the &lt;strong&gt;Regenerate&lt;/strong&gt; button next to the key you wish to create a new one for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AzCopy to the rescue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a couple of different tools, that uses the Blob Service REST API, but they all suffered from the same problem as the browser download option - speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/avidebbo"&gt;David Ebbo&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/04/01/azcopy-using-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx"&gt;AzCopy&lt;/a&gt;. David works on Windows Azure Web Sites and he told me they uses that tool to copy things across blob stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just so happened that as of CTP2, AzCopy supports the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/04/01/azcopy-using-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx"&gt;Asynchronous Cross-Account Copy Blob&lt;/a&gt; feature of the Blob Service REST API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: To use this feature, your storage account must have been created after June 7th 2012. Read more about this limitaion on the previous link&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this enables you to do is to copy from one store to another, without the need to first copying the data locally. This drastically improved the transfer speed. Using AzCopy I was getting speeds at around 45MB/s instead of 4MB/s!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up using the following command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AzCopy
https://&amp;lt;sourceaccount&amp;gt;.blob.core.windows.net/&amp;lt;sourcecontainer&amp;gt;/ 
https://&amp;lt;destaccount&amp;gt;.blob.core.windows.net/&amp;lt;destcontainer&amp;gt;/
/sourcekey:&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;
/destkey:&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;
/S
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it worked great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A word of caution on Azure Disks vs Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had copied the VHD files to my second subscription, I set out to re-create my virtual machines. This is where I messed up a bit. I went into &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Machines&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;Images&lt;/strong&gt; where I created images of the VHD files. What I should have done is gone into &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Machines&lt;/strong&gt; followed by &lt;strong&gt;Disks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two is that images are like templates. You use them to create a completley new VHD file, based on the image, that you then use as a disk for your virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was copying existing machines across, I just needed to create disks directly, that I then used to create my virtual machines from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I created a virtual machine from one of the images, it worked fine (I could login to the machine), except for Azure getting stuck while provisioning my machine. So even though the machine was functional, it was not sitting quite right with Azure. Once I changed to use a disk, it immediatly behaved as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me when I tell you that this has not been out of laziness, but rather the instinct to survive, but hopefully we've taken a couple of important decisions to remedy this in the future&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what does it take to create a template (with Nuget support)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, quite a lot actually. It definitely takes a lot more than I anticipated and it is quite obvious that that tooling was not created for performing anything else than trivial template tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is basically the steps we have to do extract the template from the projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Visual Studio and load the solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File -&gt; Export Template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure "Project Template" is selected on the first page of the Wizard + select the correct project in the drop-down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out template name, description, icon and preview image (either use the Browse button or copy/paste the path)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the template to the default (non-changeable) location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go the output location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break open the zip file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the MyTemplate.vstemplate file (yes, they all get this name when you export)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the "DefaultName" element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify all .cs files and so that the namespace declarations (and other things you need to like assembly name etc) so it uses the $safeprojectname$ placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert the &lt;package&gt; node (and sub-nodes), which contains information on which Nuget packages to install + versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zip up the content again (making sure you get the folder structure right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the zip to the right location in our VSIX project (ProjectTemplates\CSharp\Web)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back into visual studio, include the zip in the project, edit it's build action to "content" and configure it to be included in the VSI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to repeat these things for each and everyone of the templates we ship. We currently have 9 C# templates and that is already quite a work load to do for each new release of Nancy we put out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that was not enough, the awesome &lt;a href="http://wizardsofsmart.net/"&gt;Ryan Riley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/panesofglass"&gt;@panesofglass&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter) and &lt;a href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;amp;author=7"&gt;Christiaan Baes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/chrissie1"&gt;@chrissie1&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter) send us pull-requests for adding F# and VB.NET templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pushed the number of template count a bit into the 20's and this is pretty much where our work efforts kept coming to a grinding halt. The sheer amount of work required to get these new templates out is what made me start (and abandon) the work several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, me and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/grumpydev"&gt;@grumpydev&lt;/a&gt; took the decision to only support the C# templates moving forward. We really appreciate the work put in by Ryan and Christiaan, but we came to the conclusion that the vast majority of our users are C# users and the added workload could not justify us supporting F# and VB.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we would really like to thank Ryan and Christiaan for their work and support and would like to encourage them to either support the templates themselves, or see someone else in the community step up and do it for them (or why not team up with them if these templates are in your interest?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By deciding to only focus on the C# templates, we reduce our workload by a huge chunk moving forward and thanks to the awesome &lt;a href="http://devlead.se"&gt;Mattias Karlsson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/devload"&gt;@devlead&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter), whom sent us a pull-request last night with the C# templates updated to 0.22.1, we expect to have these in your Visual Studio any day now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also decided to look into the &lt;a href="http://sidewaffle.com/"&gt;Sidewaffle&lt;/a&gt; project as an alternative to the VSIX distribution. If anyone would like to offer their Sidewaffle expertise or just help out, please let us know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your patience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back when &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; updated the design of their web page, they introduces a change that has annoyed a lot of people; they decided to truncate the file/folder name in the repository browser. This makes it impossible to distinguish files/folders that follow a naming conventions, such as namespace hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;What I did was create a very simple Google Chrome extension, called &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/githubexpandinizr/cbehdjjcilgnejbpnjhobkiiggkedfib"&gt;GitHub.Expandinizr&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; solves the problem. I say kinda, because it is a quick hack really and it was not designed to be prefect. That said, if you can improve it, then please send a pull-request, you can find the source at &lt;a href="https://github.com/thecodejunkie/github.expandinizr"&gt;github.com/thecodejunkie/github.expandinizr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it do? All it really does is that when it detects that you are browsing github.com, it will inject a single css class into the page to remove the ellipsis from the file/folder name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.css-truncate.css-truncate-target {
    display: inline !important;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This css class is usually sets the &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property to &lt;code&gt;inline-block&lt;/code&gt; with an added &lt;code&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; that has been set to &lt;code&gt;ellipsis&lt;/code&gt;. By changing the display we prevent it, in a rather crude way, to ellipsis the text. Notice that the css declaration has been marked as &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; which will ensure it gets higher priority than the one in the GitHub css declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Known issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, this is a hack. If the un-ellipsed text becomes too long, then it could cause the new width of the repository browser to push into other page elements, such as the sidebar navigation on the right hand side of the design. This is especially noticeable on the main page of the repository browser, since the sidebar is expanded and takes up much more horizontal space, than when it has been collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've fine with this, so at present I am not going to spend any time trying to figure out an alternative approach, that resolves this issues (I spend 10 minutes on it and got a decent result, but it caused other problems). But, like I said, if you come up with a better solution, send me a pull-request with an updated &lt;a href="https://github.com/thecodejunkie/github.expandinizr/blob/master/ext/content/inject.css"&gt;inject.css&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;All-in-all&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fun learning experience. It was the first time that I created a proper Chrome Extension and it was certainly the first time I published it in the Chrome Store. Who knew it cost $5 to become a publisher in the store? Now I know!&lt;/p&gt;

I made sure I downloaded my content before the service shut down but did not make any effort in relocating. Why? I had gotten to the point where I thought there was something inherently wrong with the way that blogging services and blog engines work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blog, in its purest form, is nothing but information with a bit of formatting, added to make it look nice, yet each service (and engine) seem to have need to mangle the content. They do this by either converting your data into HTML, thus losing the initial separation of content and formatting, and/or store it in a proprietary format. Either way, as soon as you have handed over your post, you are no longer in control and that bugs me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking around for options on how to solve this, I got more and more keen on the idea of using &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, that lets you write your posts using Markdown and then automatically convert them to static pages using &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that really appealed to me were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would get to write my content in a very neutral markup language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could store my posts in a normal Git repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pages would be static and there would be no need for databases or other software to run it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;While looking into this, I asked &lt;a href="http://philliphaydon.com"&gt;Phillip Haydon&lt;/a&gt;, whom at the time was using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, about some advice on how to get started. He gave me some pointers, but also told me he wanted to build his own version of Jekyll, with his opinions on how such a tool should work, using &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; - obviously this was something I had to use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phillip started hacking on his tool and with the help of &lt;a href="http://jonathanchannon.com"&gt;Jonathan Channon&lt;/a&gt; he ended up creating &lt;a href="https://github.com/sandra/sandra.snow"&gt;Sandra.Snow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ReadMe file, in the repository, describes Sandra.Snow as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sandra.Snow is a Jekyll inspired static site generation tool that can be run locally, as a CAAS(Compiler as a Service) or setup with Azure to build your site when your repository changes. It is built on top of NancyFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on building a blog, using Sandra.Snow, for a while now and you are looking at the result. The reason it took me a while was a combination of me wanting to create my own design (responsive, clean, semantic HTML and so on) and the lack of willpower to get it done with. Happy to say that I am at least happy enough to put it out now, even though I still have some finishing touches I would like to sort out in the coming weeks (hopefully you will not notice them the same way I do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much consideration, I have decided not to convert my entire backlog (I got a data backup from Posterous before they shutdown) to the new blog, but instead I will be cherry-picking posts that I'll convert. I simply see no point to convert post that I feel are out dates and that does not add any value any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
