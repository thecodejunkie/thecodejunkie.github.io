&lt;p&gt;Believe me when I tell you that this has not been out of laziness, but rather the instinct to survive, but hopefully we've taken a couple of important reasons to remedy this in the future&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what does it take to create a template (with Nuget support)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, quite a lot actually. It definitely takes a lot more than I anticipated and it is quite obvious that that tooling was not created for performing anything else than trivial template tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is basically the steps we have to do extract the template from the projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Visual Studio and load the solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File -&gt; Export Template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure "Project Template" is selected on the first page of the Wizard + select the correct project in the drop-down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out template name, description, icon and preview image (either use the Browse button or copy/paste the path)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the template to the default (non-changeable) location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go the output location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break open the zip file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the MyTemplate.vstemplate file (yes, they all get this name when you export)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the "DefaultName" element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify all .cs files and so that the namespace declarations (and other things you need to like assembly name etc) so it uses the $safeprojectname$ placeholder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert the &lt;package&gt; node (and sub-nodes), which contains information on which Nuget packages to install + versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zip up the content again (making sure you get the folder structure right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the zip to the right location in our VSIX project (ProjectTemplates\CSharp\Web)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back into visual studio, include the zip in the project, edit it's build action to "content" and configure it to be included in the VSI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to repeat these things for each and everyone of the templates we ship. We currently have 9 C# templates and that is already quite a work load to do for each new release of Nancy we put out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that was not enough, the awesome &lt;a href="http://wizardsofsmart.net/"&gt;Ryan Riley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/panesofglass"&gt;@panesofglass&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter) and &lt;a href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;amp;author=7"&gt;Christiaan Baes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/chrissie1"&gt;@chrissie1&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter) send us pull-requests for adding F# and VB.NET templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pushed the number of template count a bit into the 20's and this is pretty much where our work efforts kept coming to a grinding halt. The sheer amount of work required to get these new templates out is what made me start (and abandon) the work several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, me and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/grumpydev"&gt;@grumpydev&lt;/a&gt; took the decision to only support the C# templates moving forward. We really appreciate the work put in by Ryan and Christiaan, but we came to the conclusion that the vast majority of our users are C# users and the added workload could not justify us supporting F# and VB.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we would really like to thank Ryan and Christiaan for their work and support and would like to encourage them to either support the templates themselves, or see someone else in the community step up and do it for them (or why not team up with them if these templates are in your interest?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By deciding to only focus on the C# templates, we reduce our workload by a huge chunk moving forward and thanks to the awesome &lt;a href="http://devlead.se"&gt;Mattias Karlsson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/devload"&gt;@devlead&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter), whom sent us a pull-request last night with the C# templates updated to 0.22.1, we expect to have these in your Visual Studio any day now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also decided to look into the &lt;a href="http://sidewaffle.com/"&gt;Sidewaffle&lt;/a&gt; project as an alternative to the VSIX distribution. If anyone would like to offer their Sidewaffle expertise or just help out, please let us know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your patience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back when &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; updated the design of their web page, they introduces a change that has annoyed a lot of people; they decided to truncate the file/folder name in the repository browser. This makes it impossible to distinguish files/folders that follow a naming conventions, such as namespace hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back when &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; updated the design of their web page, they introduces a change that has annoyed a lot of people; they decided to truncate the file/folder name in the repository browser. This makes it impossible to distinguish files/folders that follow a naming conventions, such as namespace hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;What I did was create a very simple Google Chrome extension, called &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/githubexpandinizr/cbehdjjcilgnejbpnjhobkiiggkedfib"&gt;GitHub.Expandinizr&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; solves the problem. I say kinda, because it is a quick hack really and it was not designed to be prefect. That said, if you can improve it, then please send a pull-request, you can find the source at &lt;a href="https://github.com/thecodejunkie/github.expandinizr"&gt;github.com/thecodejunkie/github.expandinizr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it do? All it really does is that when it detects that you are browsing github.com, it will inject a single css class into the page to remove the ellipsis from the file/folder name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.css-truncate.css-truncate-target {
    display: inline !important;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This css class is usually sets the &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property to &lt;code&gt;inline-block&lt;/code&gt; with an added &lt;code&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; that has been set to &lt;code&gt;ellipsis&lt;/code&gt;. By changing the display we prevent it, in a rather crude way, to ellipsis the text. Notice that the css declaration has been marked as &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; which will ensure it gets higher priority than the one in the GitHub css declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Known issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, this is a hack. If the un-ellipsed text becomes too long, then it could cause the new width of the repository browser to push into other page elements, such as the sidebar navigation on the right hand side of the design. This is especially noticeable on the main page of the repository browser, since the sidebar is expanded and takes up much more horizontal space, than when it has been collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've fine with this, so at present I am not going to spend any time trying to figure out an alternative approach, that resolves this issues (I spend 10 minutes on it and got a decent result, but it caused other problems). But, like I said, if you come up with a better solution, send me a pull-request with an updated &lt;a href="https://github.com/thecodejunkie/github.expandinizr/blob/master/ext/content/inject.css"&gt;inject.css&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;All-in-all&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fun learning experience. It was the first time that I created a proper Chrome Extension and it was certainly the first time I published it in the Chrome Store. Who knew it cost $5 to become a publisher in the store? Now I know!&lt;/p&gt;

I made sure I downloaded my content before the service shut down but did not make any effort in relocating. Why? I had gotten to the point where I thought there was something inherently wrong with the way that blogging services and blog engines work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blog, in its purest form, is nothing but information with a bit of formatting, added to make it look nice, yet each service (and engine) seem to have need to mangle the content. They do this by either converting your data into HTML, thus losing the initial separation of content and formatting, and/or store it in a proprietary format. Either way, as soon as you have handed over your post, you are no longer in control and that bugs me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking around for options on how to solve this, I got more and more keen on the idea of using &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, that lets you write your posts using Markdown and then automatically convert them to static pages using &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that really appealed to me were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would get to write my content in a very neutral markup language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could store my posts in a normal Git repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pages would be static and there would be no need for databases or other software to run it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;While looking into this, I asked &lt;a href="http://philliphaydon.com"&gt;Phillip Haydon&lt;/a&gt;, whom at the time was using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, about some advice on how to get started. He gave me some pointers, but also told me he wanted to build his own version of Jekyll, with his opinions on how such a tool should work, using &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; - obviously this was something I had to use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phillip started hacking on his tool and with the help of &lt;a href="http://jonathanchannon.com"&gt;Jonathan Channon&lt;/a&gt; he ended up creating &lt;a href="https://github.com/sandra/sandra.snow"&gt;Sandra.Snow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ReadMe file, in the repository, describes Sandra.Snow as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sandra.Snow is a Jekyll inspired static site generation tool that can be run locally, as a CAAS(Compiler as a Service) or setup with Azure to build your site when your repository changes. It is built on top of NancyFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on building a blog, using Sandra.Snow, for a while now and you are looking at the result. The reason it took me a while was a combination of me wanting to create my own design (responsive, clean, semantic HTML and so on) and the lack of willpower to get it done with. Happy to say that I am at least happy enough to put it out now, even though I still have some finishing touches I would like to sort out in the coming weeks (hopefully you will not notice them the same way I do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much consideration, I have decided not to convert my entire backlog (I got a data backup from Posterous before they shutdown) to the new blog, but instead I will be cherry-picking posts that I'll convert. I simply see no point to convert post that I feel are out dates and that does not add any value any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
