			<p>Working on Nancy has always been a labor of love. We have never thought about charging for commercial use or in any other put up a pay wall that restricts your use of the framework. During the past five years, thousands of hours have been put into making Nancy what is it today and it makes us extremely proud that it is being used in production, all over the world and in a wide range of products.</p>

<p>That said, even though Nancy itself is free to use, the development of it is not. Each hour we spend working on Nancy is an hour less we could have spent working on other personal projects or spending time with friends and family.</p>

<p>As with most project, time is the most valuable commodity we have (apart from domain knowledge!) and its availability varies over time. Our ambition for Nancy is far greater than the time we have at our disposal. Even as little as a couple of hours of extra time, each week, would have a tremendous impact.</p>

<p>It is for this reason we are now turning toward you, our community of existing users, that put Nancy into production and help you ship software. If Nancy adds value to your organization then we would ask for your attention for a couple of minutes and read on about how you can help us keep delivering awesome stuff.</p>

<p>Either way we are going to keep working on Nancy, but together we can take it to another level. We won't be able to do it without your help!</p>

			<p>Usually when we put out a new version of Nancy, we also bump the version number of all other Nancy packages, even if they have not had any changes.</p>

<p>This approach has made it easy to know that you are using a version that is guaranteed to be compatible with the current Nancy version. It has made upgrading easy since you just update the Nancy package and it will update all other packages that has a dependency on the Nancy package.</p>

<p>However, now that the <code>v1.x</code> releases have officially entered <a href="/2015/11/08/our-plans-for-nancy-1-x-and-beyond">maintenance mode</a>, we have decided that the <code>v1.4.2</code> release will break this tradition. For the <code>v1.4.2</code> release we will <em>only</em> update the Nancy package it self and leave the remaining packages at <code>v1.4.1</code>.</p>

			<p>At the time that I write this, Nancy is less than two weeks (the 20th!) shy of turning 5 years old. For any open-source project that is quite an achievement and I dare to say that for one that is based on .NET it is amazing.</p>

<p>If we turn it into numbers, we put out 37 releases (a bit more than 7 per year), had 228 unique (only counting the main repository) contributors and 1237 closed pull-requests. We have had the pleasure of seeing the community embrace it, job ads pop up and people traveling to conferences, all over the world, to deliver sessions on our framework. Amazing!</p>

<p>In February, of this year, we put out the <code>v1.0</code> release and just the other day we released <code>v1.4.1</code> into the wild. Needless to say, it has been a very rewarding and humbling experience.
Now, it might sound like I am about to drop the bomb and tell you all that we have decided to discontinue working on Nancy. In fact, that is the exact opposite of what I am going to tell you!</p>

			<p>I am pleased to be able to announce that I am now able to accept Nancy based contract work (world wide).</p>

<p>If you are building products based on Nancy and you are looking for help with (but not limited to) code reviews, training / workshops, team coaching / mentoring, project implementations or problem solving, then you should drop me a line. I am based in Sweden so ideally looking for clients that are comfortable with remote workers, although I will also be available to occasionally work on-site.</p>

<p>On the legal side, all contracts will go through my employer, <a href="http://tretton37.com">tretton37</a>, which is one of the top consultancy agencies in Sweden, so you won't be dealing directly with a "one man band". Another benefit of this is that I am not the only one capable of a providing this kind of expertise at tretton37, so even if I am unavailable at the time, chances are good that we will still be able to provide you with the help you need.</p>

			<p>Extending the Unity editor UI is pretty simple. They have a bunch of classes that you inherit from and the editor will automatically discover and wire them up for you.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I started looking into extending the editor with a custom window for some behavior tree work I am doing. I wanted to create a simple tree designer.</p>

<p>The initial spike went well and I managed to open up a new window, with very little code and no problems, but then I fell into the rabbit hole...</p>

			<p>We have all been there. We have had one or more awesome project ideas but we knew that it was either too big to tackle on our own, or we were lacking experience in some key areas to make it happen.</p>

<p>Instinctively we start shopping around for help amonst friends and contacts, but it is still hard to find someone that shares your vision, have the time to help out and that has the skills that are required to pull it off.</p>

<p>So we tell ourselves that it probably was not such a good idea anyway and move along. Recognise yourself? I sure know I have found myself in that situation more times than I can remember.</p>

<p>But it does not have to be that way. There are millions of people out there that are feeling the same thing and if we could only find them then we could do amazing things togehter. This is exactly the vision that <a href="http://twitter.com/spazchickens">Colleen Wilson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/justin35f">Justin Hammond</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mrdeprey">Shawn Deprey</a> have with their <strong>Indie Team Up</strong> idea.</p>

<p>I had the oppertunity to catch them on Skype and talk to help about Indie Team Up and their vision for it.</p>

			<p>Nancy has always been disconnected from the underlaying host, enabling you to run Nancy on top of ASP.NET, self-hosted, as part of your WCF service, or embedded pretty much wherever you want.</p>

<p>We were also the first full framework to adopt OWIN based hosting, through our <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nancy.Hosting.Owin/">Nancy.Hosting.Owin</a> nuget. With the recent 0.23.0 release we moved our <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/pull/1544">OWIN host</a> into the core project as a stepping stone.</p>

			<p>Recently we had a meeting that was made up of Me, <a href="http://twitter.com/grumpydev">Steven</a> and most of the <a href="http://nancyfx.org/mvm.html">Most Valued Minions</a>. On the agenda was everything from discussing the governance of the project, to making plans for a v1, looking over the state of our GitHub repository and much more.</p>

<p>A lot of ground was covered and the intention of this blog series is to try and get down as much as possible of what we said and decided. We believe in developing in the open, so it is important that we get the information out to our community.</p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions, suggestions and just want to share your thoughts on the subjects!</p>

<p>Here is a tl;dr of the posts</p>

<ul>
<li>Most Valued Minions can now commit code</li>
<li>Cleaned up our labels on GitHub</li>
<li>Cleaning up all the open issues and pull-requests</li>
<li>Aiming for to put out a new release every 8-weekish</li>
<li>Pushing towards a v1 release</li>
<li>v1 will be a dual-target release, targeting both .net 4.0 and .net 4.5</li>
<li>Post-v1 we will support .net 4.0 for about 6 months</li>
<li>We are going to close down our Google group in about 1 month</li>
<li>We are going all-in on OWIN, bringing it into our core</li>
<li>We are fully committed to supporting ASP.NET vNext</li>
<li>We released <a href="http://blog.nancyfx.org">blog.nancyfx.org</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Happy reading!</p>
